OMNetFpgaSim is is part of an effort to evaluate the impact of different queuing disciplines on the performance of an FPGA server connected to multiple clients. It implements a client-server network with custom messages from clients to a server. The server processes the clients' messages based on message type and set configurations (processing latency, queueing discipline, etc.) . The goal of the project is to provide a tool for modeling and simulation of client-server architectures, enabling users to analyze and optimize communication protocols and system performance.â€‹
